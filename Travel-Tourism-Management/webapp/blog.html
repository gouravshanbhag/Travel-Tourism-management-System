                                We entered the Aihole monument complex on a cold December morning at about 9 am. It was absolutely beautiful with the golden glow of the sun touching the sandstone walls of the temples. The timing also seemed perfect since we only saw five other visitor groups and could enjoy some of the exclusivity to explore slowly and click photos. </p>
